BTernary.js is a javascript library for performing arithmetic in balanced ternary. It
represents balanced ternary numbers as strings of '-0+' characters, and implements basic
arithmetic operations.

EXAMPLE
=======

Bternary.html gives an example of using the library to write a simple balanced
ternary calculator. It references btCalc.js to provide controller code, as well as the
bternary.js library and bternary.css.


UNIT TESTS
==========

To run the unit tests, execute btTests.js while including bternary.js. For instance:

  jsc bternary.js btTests.js 

It should print "All tests passed" upon success, or an error message if something failed.
If nothing prints, it is likely that bternary.js is not being included properly.
